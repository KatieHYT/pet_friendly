Love Blue Bottle coffee...it is smooth and enjoyable and this walk up cafe/kiosk is great for a Sunday treat with my dog. However I look forward to the opening of a closer Blue Bottle on South Van Ness soon!

Super cute hole in the wall place near Patricia's Green! The coffee is top notch and they also have cookies and other pastries. The cappuccino is super smooth! They are dog friendly too and have dog treats at the register. Only complaints are that it's pretty pricey and there aren't many places to sit outside.

Really great coffee. Highly recommend. They've got dog treats too.

Great coffee! Friendly staff and the dog always gets a treat ðŸ¦´
